Route Resolvers are activated before given route so we have data in our component before initialization. We set up resolvers in routes.ts file for the needed components.
Resolvers are used to get the data on activated route which we set up in our routes.ts file.
They are used to replace api calls on component initialization with url route activated methods which means that components cannot init if there is no data, which
eases error handling and we also navigate back on errors, which is another good thing
We make a file _resolvers which is injectable globally. 
Then we make a resolver for the needed components. Naming convention is as follows - [component name].resolver.ts
